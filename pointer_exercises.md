## Beginner Level

### Pointer basics: Print the value and address

- [X] Write a program that declares an integer variable, assigns a value, and
      then uses a pointer to print the variable's value and address.

### Pointer arithmetic

- [X] Create an array of integers. Use a pointer to iterate through the array
      elements and print each element using pointer arithmetic (e.g., * (ptr +
      i)).

### Swap two variables using pointers

- [X] Write a function void swap(int * a, int * b) that swaps the values of two
      integers via pointers. Call it from main.

## Intermediate Level

### String manipulation with pointers

- [X] Write a function that takes a string (char array) pointer and converts
      all lowercase letters to uppercase using pointer manipulation.

### Dynamic memory allocation

- [X] Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of
      integers (size input by the user), fills it with values, prints the
      values, and then frees the memory.

### Function returning a pointer

- [X] Implement a function that returns a pointer to the largest element in an
      integer array.

## Advanced Level

### Pointer to pointer

- [X] Write a program that uses a pointer to a pointer (double pointer) to
      modify a variable's value.

### Linked list node creation

- [X] Implement a basic singly linked list node struct and write a function to
      create a new node with a given integer value using pointers.

### Pointer to a function

- [ ] Write a program that uses a pointer to a function to perform different
      operations (add, subtract, multiply) on two integers.

## Expert Level

### Implement memcpy using pointers

- [ ] Write your own version of the standard memcpy function that copies n
      bytes from a source memory block to a destination memory block using only
      pointers.
